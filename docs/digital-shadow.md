# Digital Shadow

The term ‘Digital Shadow’ is a metaphor for digital information related to a thing or being, actively collected, enriched and guarded on behalf of that [entity](entity.md), available from a single access point. By definition, the digital shadow fits perfectly in the Internet of Things concept.

## Description
A digital shadow provides a digital presence for a thing or being and collaboration among them. The primary purpose is to increase the utilisation and efficiency of physical resources for a more sustainable world. As such, the ‘digital shadow’ is a representation of a real-world object, palette or even an entire truck load. It reflects their individual shape, history, current and expected future status. 
A digital shadow is a software agent that collects, stores, enriched and shares the information like a personal assistant of the [entity](entity.md) it represents. These shadows are first class citizens of the “Cloud”.

From a fundamental point of view, digital shadows are [‘entity-centric’](entity.md), not bounded to a single software process but intended to be updated by several participating and authorised services during its lifetime and across business domains.

The figure is an example of a digital shadow and the real physical world. Like a shadow in the real world, the digital shadow represents a thing or being in the virtual world. Besides monitoring its real world (physical) counterpart it can also act as a virtual version of a human personal assistant to serve in the interest of the [entity](entity.md). A digital shadow is an agent in cyberspace, not residing on the physical [entity](entity.md) itself.
From a technical point of view, the digital shadow is a semantic communication framework. The information stored in a single electronic register and described with use of a knowledge base containing definitions of concepts and relations. Some of these concepts represent conditions and rules. Actions are performed by fixed but small set of hard-coded basic functions as part of the digital shadow access point.

Digital shadows are event driven and the rules stored in its knowledge base define the response on new information aka digital shadow events. These events are either being disposed or remembered as immutable facts just like the concepts in the knowledge base. This means that all information remains available during the life cycle of a  digital shadow.
Depending on the extensiveness of the used knowledge base, the actions of a digital shadow are more or less based on understanding instead of spelling out each step.
 
This allows users to instruct digital shadows without the need for translation of functional requirements into a technical programming language. The actions of a digital shadow are limited to a combination of basic functions. For sake of simplicity, extension of these basic  functions is not supported by design. Additional functions should be implemented as a higher level framework on top of the digital shadow framework. Each shadow represents exactly one [entity](entity.md) and is implemented by one software agent. Since these software agents make use of functional descriptions and instructions stored in a knowledge base, they are referred as semantic software agents.

The digital shadows live in a semantic multi-agent environment, also known as the digital habitat. This environment is managed by a supervising semantic agent which can be instructed and configured in the same functional and flexible way as its inhabitants, the digital shadows. The main tasks of the supervising agent is to handle the access control for the habitat as a gatekeeper, to control a common knowledge base and to control the lifecycle for the inhabitants, the software agents. 

The main difference with traditional information systems (process oriented approaches) is the [entity-centric](entity.md) approach. The  concept of a digital shadow is used in the EURIDICE project to create an easy way to connect and interact with goods to optimise the supply chain. During the EURIDICE project it became clear that this concept was applicable for all kinds of entities. In the succeeding iCargo project this concepts is also used for abstract objects like "transportation orders".

## Alternative definitions

In 2008 the term 'Cyber Shadow' has been used to indicated how visible a individual, business, organisation, corporation or object is within the internet, although it would usually refer to a person. It is often confused with Internet footprint. Although very similar, the distinction lies in the fact that no interaction is required to obtain a Cyber Shadow. The term Digital Shadow is often used as an alternative with the same meaning.
It is generally taken to mean how easy it is to find someone using popular search engines such as Google. Someone with a larger Cyber Shadow is easier to find than someone with a smaller Cyber Shadow.

To deal with the digital explosion requires development of organisation-wide policies to ensure information security and retention, as well as data access. The digital/cyber shadow refers to information about a person, including names in financial records and mailing lists, web surfing histories or images of the individual taken by security cameras in public places.

Anno 2014, the game *Watch Dogs* uses also the term 'digital shadow' and refer to people as data-clusters containing all the information that is available about them or related to them, waiting to be exploited.
