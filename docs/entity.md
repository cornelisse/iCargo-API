# The entity-centric approach

The entity-centric approach is an information and modelling paradigm by looking at the world through the eyes of a single *entity*. By storing information about an specific entity at one place and considering only the aspects that matters to that entity, the problem space of complex processes can be reduced to much simpler to understand and easier to control information elements.

An *entity* is a thing with distinct and independent existence ([Oxford dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/entity)). Something that exists in itself, actually or hypothetically([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity)) and can be a concrete or abstract object, such as a thing, person, service or a concept. 
The entity-centric approach focuses on the state and changes of an individual entity during its entire lifetime. All known information about an entity is collected at one place, in a single electronic document also known as its *[digital shadow]()*. This in contrast to a process-oriented approach where data about the entities is being dispersed over multiple databases or even worse in [information siloâ€™s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo). A strongly related concept is the [artefact-centric business process model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact-centric_business_process_model) where the lifecycle of an artefact(entity) is prominent too.

## History
Building upon the [EURIDICE](http://www.insiel.eu/project/euridice) concept of a *cargo-centric* approach, the [iCargo project](http://www.i-cargo.eu/content/about-icargo-project) has extended that concept into a more generic entity-centric approach. Basically this means that information is being collected per business object (entity). In the traditional process oriented approach, the cargo left its digital footprints scattered across multiple isolated systems. 
The goal of the entity-centric-approach is to reduce the complexity of the supply chain into individual and smaller parts. The information about each entity is being collected, stored, processed and shared by one software component that acts and serves in the best interest of that entity.
 
Instead of trying to control flows of goods from above, through centralized information systems that have the perception of knowing what is happening in the supply chain, the intelligence is put in the flow itself, as intelligent goods. 
The cargo (best) knows its destination, its current environment, its content, et cetera. Instead of consulting a centralized monolithic system to acquire information regarding a particular container or pallet, the entity of subject is approached directly. However this requires a different way of organising the data in a so-called entity-centric-approach. 

The entity-centric approach differs from a process-oriented approach mainly in two aspects:
* The organisation of data collected together for each business object instead of being spread over multiple systems of different owners;
* Automated context-aware actions on behalf of the business object to collect, enrich and distribute information about that business object.

The EURIDICE project uses software agents as technological solution to implement an entity-centric approach. However, within iCargo the required services are referred as entity-centric services to decouple and distinguish the functional capabilities from the technical implementation.
